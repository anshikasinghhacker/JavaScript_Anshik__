//but there is a limitation with variable var it is accessible outside the scope lets see the example
//console.log(a); //output -- a is not defined it mean a is not accessible outside the scope
//console.log(b); //output-- b is not defined it mean b is not accessible outside the scope

//console.log(c); //output -- 300 its means var c is accessible outside the scope that's why we not use var this the the main limitation of var
//console.log(d);//output -- 400
